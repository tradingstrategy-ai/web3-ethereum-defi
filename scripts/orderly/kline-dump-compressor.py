"""Orderly kline dump parser.

- Orderly kline is the historical data of their trades
- Available as CSV file as a request
- This script reads and compresses it to a more efficient format
- We take only one of the timeframes
- Kline data doesn't contain open interest

Example data:

.. code-block:: csv
