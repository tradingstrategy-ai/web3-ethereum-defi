    :param uniswap:
         Uniswap deployment on a Ganache mainnet fork.
         Set up prior calling this function.
         See `ganache.py` and `test_ganache.py` for more details.

    :param base_token:
         The token of which tax properties we are figuring out.

    :param quote_token:
         Address of the quote token used for the trading pair. E.g. `BUDS`, `WBNB`
         Based on this information we can derive Uniswap trading pair address.

    :param buy_account:
         The account that does initial buy to measure the buy tax.
         This account must be loaded with gas money (ETH/BNB) and `quote_token`
         for a purchase.

    :param sell_account:
         The account that receives the token transfer and does the sell to measure the sell tax.
         This account must be loaded with gas money for the sell.

    :param approve:
        Perform quote token approval before wap test

    :param base_token_details:
        Pass base token details. If not given automatically fetch.

    :param quote_token_details:
        Pass quote token details. If not given automatically fetch.

    :param gas_limit:
        Use this gas limit for all transactions, so that
        we do not need to call eth_estimateGas on the node.

    :param gas_price:
        Use this gas price for all transactions, so that
        we do not need to call eth_estimateGas on the node.

    :return:
        ToxTaxInfo tells us what we figure out about taxes.
        This can be later recorded to a database.
