    - Lagoon Finance: :py:class:`eth_defi.lagoon.vault.LagoonVault`

    - Velvet Capital: :py:class:`eth_defi.velvet.vault.VelvetVault`

    Code exists, but does not confirm the interface yet:

    - Enzyme Finance: :py:class:`eth_defi.enzyme.vault.Vault`

    **Vault covered functionality**

    - Fetching the current balances, deposits or redemptions

        - Either using naive polling approach with :py:meth:`fetch_portfolio`
        - Listen to vault events for deposits and redemptions using :py:meth:`get_flow_manager`

    - Get vault information with :py:meth:`fetch_info`
        - No standardised data structures or functions yet

    - Build a swap through a vault
        - No standardised data structure yet

    - Update vault position valuations
        - No standardised data structure yet

    **Integration check list**

    Integration tests needed for:

    - ☑️ read vault core info
    - ☑️ read vault investors
    - ☑️ read vault share price
    - ☑️ read vault share token
    - ☑️ read all positions
    - ☑️ read NAV
    - ☑️ read pending redemptions to know how much USDC we will need for the next settlement cycles
    - ☑️ deposit integration test
    - ☑️ redemption integration
    - ☑️ swap integration test
    - ☑️ re-valuation integration test
    - ☑️ only asset manager allowed to swap negative test
    - ☑️ only valuation commitee allowed to update vault valuations (if applicable)
    - ☑️ can redeem if enough USDC to settle
    - ☑️ cannot redeem not enough USDC to settle
