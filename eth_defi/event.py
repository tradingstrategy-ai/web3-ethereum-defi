    """Get events using eth_getLogs API.

    This is a stateless method, as oppose to JSON-RPC filter objects.
    It can be safely called against nodes which do not provide `eth_newFilter` API, like Infura.

    We are not doing any throttling or API error recovery:
    If you ask for too many events once this function and your Ethereum node are likely to blow up.

    Example how to get all ERC-20 transfers to a target address:

    .. code-block:: python

        IERC20 = get_contract(web3, "IERC20.json")
        Transfer = IERC20.events.Transfer
        all_transfers_to_user = list(fetch_all_events(web3, Transfer, argument_filters={"to": owner}))

    :param web3: Web3 instance
    :param event: Event class grabbed from a Contract proxy class, like `IERC20.events.Transfer`.
    :param address: The smart contract address of the event emitter. Set to none to capture events from all the smart contracts.
    :param argument_filters: Filters based on the event structure, e.g. `to` field `IERC20.events.Transfer`
    :param from_block: Limit block range. Set to `1` to get all the events, ever.
    :param to_block: Limit block range
