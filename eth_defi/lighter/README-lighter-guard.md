# Lighter guard integration architecture

Security architecture for depositing into and withdrawing from
[Lighter](https://lighter.xyz) (a non-custodial, zero-fee perpetuals/spot DEX
built as a zk-rollup on Ethereum L1) through an asset-managed Gnosis **Safe**
controlled by `TradingStrategyModuleV0` / `GuardV0`.

This document describes how the on-chain guard whitelisting works. It mirrors
the GMX (`eth_defi/gmx/README-GMX-Lagoon.md`) and Hypercore
(`docs/README-Hypercore-guard.md`) guard integrations.

> Deployment scope: this guard integration supports only the original
> **Ethereum-settled Lighter deployment** and its USDC `ZkLighter` custody
> contract. The Robinhood work currently covers native-pool discovery,
> metrics and export only. Do not use `LighterDeployment.create_ethereum()`,
> the whitelisting helpers or public-key helpers for
> Robinhood. Robinhood documents USDG deposits into a Lighter Relayer smart
> contract on Robinhood Chain (chain id 4663), but this repository has not
> configured or verified that contract's address and ABI for guard use.
>
> Guard scope: **deposit / withdraw only** (the on-chain L1 custody flow).
> Lighter account creation happens when the Safe receives its first credited
> deposit. On-book trading (`createOrder`) is signed with the Lighter API key,
> and trading-key rotation (`changePubKey`) is a Safe-owner setup action outside
> the asset-manager guard.

## Why a Safe can use Lighter

Lighter holds all user funds in an L1 smart contract (`ZkLighter`) and keys
accounts by the **Ethereum address** that controls them. That address can be a
smart-contract wallet, so a Safe multisig can custody funds on Lighter:

- **Deposits / withdrawals** are ordinary L1 contract calls the Safe can make
  through the module.
- **Account creation** is deposit-driven: crediting the Safe address on Lighter
  creates a master account index after the deposit is processed. The day-to-day
  L2 trading key is delegated separately; its on-L1 rotation (`changePubKey`)
  is out of scope for this guard whitelist.
- **Funds stay in the L1 contract** until withdrawn with a valid zk-proof +
  the controlling address, so withdrawals remain Safe-gated.

## Architecture

```
Asset Manager ──▶ TradingStrategyModuleV0 (GuardV0) ──▶ Gnosis Safe (vault funds)
                          │ validateCall()
                          ▼
                  LighterLib.validateCall()  (external lib, DELEGATECALL)
                          │
                          ▼
                  ZkLighter L1 contract (deposit / withdraw / withdrawPendingBalance)
```

- **`GuardV0Base.sol`** holds the generic call-site / token / receiver allow
  lists and the `validateCall()` dispatch. `whitelistLighter()` registers the
  Lighter call sites, the USDC approval destination and the USDC token.
- **`LighterLib.sol`** is an external Forge library (same pattern as `GmxLib` /
  `HypercoreVaultLib`): diamond storage at `keccak256("eth_defi.lighter.v1")`,
  invoked via `DELEGATECALL` so its bytecode does not count against the guard's
  EIP-170 24 KB limit. It keeps protocol-specific allow-sets — allowed
  `ZkLighter` contract(s) and allowed asset indices (USDC) — in its own storage
  (analogous to `GmxLib`'s `allowedRouters` / `allowedMarkets`), and uses
  `IGuardChecks(address(this)).isAllowedReceiver(...)` callbacks for receiver
  checks, exactly like `GmxLib`.
- **Safe** is the fund holder and the only valid recipient of deposits/credits
  and withdrawals — enforced by the guard's `isAllowedReceiver` (set via
  `allowReceiver(safe)`).

## Lighter L1 contract (Ethereum mainnet)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Proxy (`Proxy`) | `0x3b4d794a66304f130a4db8f2551b0070dfcf5ca7` |
| Implementation (`ZkLighter`) | `0x831ef69bab8af8b1037a4961b8d0674b124e7008` |
| Chain | Ethereum mainnet (chain id 1) |
| Deposit asset | USDC (keyed by `uint16` asset index, see `USDC_ASSET_INDEX()`) |

Lighter keys deposits by **asset index**, not token address. Helpers on the
contract: `USDC_ASSET_INDEX()`, `tokenToAssetIndex(address)`,
`addressToAccountIndex(address)`, `getPendingBalance(address,uint16)`.

## Whitelisted activities

`whitelistLighter(zkLighter, usdc, assetIndex, notes)` registers the call sites
below, plus `allowApprovalDestination(zkLighter)` (for the USDC `approve`) and
the USDC token, and seeds the library's allowed-contract and allowed-asset-index
(USDC) sets. The operator must additionally call `allowReceiver(safe)` so the
Safe is a valid recipient (same requirement as `whitelistGMX`).

| Selector | Function | Guard validation |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| `0x095ea7b3` | `approve(ZkLighter, amount)` on USDC | Approval destination whitelisted |
| `0x8a857083` | `deposit(address _to, uint16 _assetIndex, uint8, uint256)` | `isAllowedReceiver(_to)` (Safe) **and** `_assetIndex` ∈ allowed assets (USDC) |
| `0xd20191bd` | `withdraw(uint48 _accountIndex, uint16 _assetIndex, uint8, uint64)` | `_assetIndex` ∈ allowed assets; moves balance to *pending* (no external recipient) |
| `0x2f25807e` | `withdrawPendingBalance(address _owner, uint16 _assetIndex, uint128)` | `isAllowedReceiver(_owner)` (Safe) **and** `_assetIndex` ∈ allowed assets |

`changePubKey(uint48,uint8,bytes)` (`0x17010c68`) is **not** whitelisted — it is
trading-key rotation and must be executed as an explicit Safe-owner setup
transaction, not by the asset-manager hot wallet.

## Fund-flow security model

A compromised asset-manager hot wallet must not be able to drain the Safe via
Lighter. Following the `GmxLib` pattern, receiver checks go through the guard's
`isAllowedReceiver` (set by `allowReceiver(safe)`); `LighterLib` adds an
`allowedAssetIndices` (USDC) check from its own storage. The fund-egress vectors
and their checks:

1. **`deposit(_to, _assetIndex, …)`** — `_to` is credited on Lighter. Without a
   check an attacker could credit *their own* account with the Safe's USDC.
   → `require(isAllowedReceiver(_to))` and `require(allowedAssetIndices[_assetIndex])`.
2. **`withdrawPendingBalance(_owner, _assetIndex, …)`** — `_owner` receives the
   released L1 funds. → same two checks on `_owner` and `_assetIndex`.
3. **`withdraw(_accountIndex, _assetIndex, …)`** — **not a fund-egress vector.**
   It only moves an account's balance into that account's *pending balance*; no
   tokens leave `ZkLighter` and there is no recipient parameter. The only L1
   egress is `withdrawPendingBalance` (item 2), receiver-checked to the Safe, so
   funds can only ever be claimed out to a whitelisted Safe. →
   `require(allowedAssetIndices[_assetIndex])` only. `_accountIndex` is not bound
   to the Safe (validateCall has no Safe address). The `ZkLighter` contract
   binds the withdrawal to `msg.sender`, not the supplied `_accountIndex` —
   `withdraw()` sets `masterAccountIndex = validateAndGetAccountIndexFromAddress(msg.sender)`
   (reverting `AdditionalZkLighter_AccountIsNotRegistered()` for an unregistered
   caller). So a compromised asset manager cannot withdraw a foreign account
   through the guard — verified end-to-end by
   `tests/guard/test_guard_lighter_lagoon.py::test_guard_lighter_withdraw_account_index_bound_by_protocol`,
   which asserts the guard permits the call but the protocol reverts with that
   exact error. `approve` is bounded by the approval destination + USDC token.

**`anyAsset` joker.** When the guard runs in "allow all assets" mode
(`anyAsset == true`), the asset-index check is skipped — receiver checks still
run. Same semantics as `GmxLib.isAllowedMarket(market, anyAsset)`. An
`anyAsset` vault may deposit any Lighter asset to the Safe but still cannot
credit/withdraw to a non-Safe receiver. The guard passes its `anyAsset` state
into `LighterLib.validateCall(selector, target, callData, anyAsset)`.

## Deposit flow (one-time approval + deposit)

```
1. approve:  performCall(USDC, approve(ZkLighter, amount), 0)
2. deposit:  performCall(ZkLighter, deposit(safe, USDC_ASSET_INDEX, routeType, amount), 0)
```

Inner effect: the Safe approves USDC to `ZkLighter`, then `ZkLighter` pulls the
USDC and credits the Safe's Lighter account.

## Withdraw flow (request + claim)

```
1. request:  performCall(ZkLighter, withdraw(accountIndex, USDC_ASSET_INDEX, routeType, amount), 0)
   ... wait for the zk-proof to settle on L1 ...
2. claim:    performCall(ZkLighter, withdrawPendingBalance(safe, USDC_ASSET_INDEX, amount), 0)
```

Funds are released on-chain directly to the Safe address.

## Account valuation (off-chain)

Ethereum Lighter account NAV is read off-chain from the public account API, not
through the guard. Use
`eth_defi.lighter.valuation.fetch_lighter_total_equity()` with the Safe's
Lighter account index and an explicit `LighterSession` to fetch
`LighterEquity`. This section's Safe and USDC flow uses an Ethereum session;
reading another deployment through its session does not configure its custody
contracts or Guard support.

`LighterEquity.get_total()` returns Lighter's canonical `total_asset_value`
field in USDC. The helper also exposes collateral, unrealised PnL, available
balance and margin requirements so downstream systems, such as trade-executor,
can report account state and size withdrawals without duplicating Lighter API
parsing.

The Lagoon + Lighter manual tutorial
`scripts/lagoon/lagoon-lighter-example.py` uses this module after the ETH
round-trip and before requesting the secure Lighter withdrawal. The guard still
only authorises the L1 custody calls described above; valuation and trading are
off-chain reads/signatures.

## Account creation (deposit-driven — not a guard call)

Lighter's
[Create accounts programmatically](https://apidocs.lighter.xyz/docs/create-accounts-programmatically)
documentation says an account can be created by depositing assets to Lighter.
After mainnet crediting completes, a master account index is generated for the
credited L1 address; the index can be checked through `addressToAccountIndex`,
`account` or `accountsByL1Address`. For a Lagoon vault, the credited L1 address
is the Safe, so the Safe becomes the account owner. No separate guard call is
involved.

Day-to-day trading is then done off-chain via a delegated L2 trading key. On
L1, that key is rotated with `changePubKey` — which is **out of scope** for
this guard whitelist. Do not confuse `changePubKey` (trading-key rotation) with
account creation.

## Creating an API key for the vault (changePubKey)

Day-to-day trading uses an off-chain L2 API key. Creating one is two steps:

1. **Generate** the API keypair off-chain (the `lighter-python` SDK; no L1 key
   needed). Use indices 4–254 for automated keys: Lighter's dedicated
   [API keys](https://apidocs.lighter.xyz/docs/api-keys) page says `{0,1,2,3}`
   are reserved for desktop/mobile interfaces and repeats that these front-end
   keys cannot be marked maker-only. Lighter's
   [Get Started](https://apidocs.lighter.xyz/docs/get-started) page currently
   says 2–254; this integration follows the stricter dedicated API-key page to
   avoid overwriting keys used by the front-end.
2. **Register** its public key on L1 via
   `ZkLighter.changePubKey(accountIndex, apiKeyIndex, pubKey)` — for a Safe this
   is a **Safe transaction** (Lighter recommends the on-chain ChangePubKey for
   multisigs). `changePubKey` binds to `msg.sender`'s registered account
   (`masterAccountIndex = validateAndGetAccountIndexFromAddress(msg.sender)`), so
   the Safe must already be a registered Lighter account.

This is a **privileged governance/setup action by the Safe owners** — it is
deliberately **not** in the asset-manager guard whitelist, so it goes directly
through the Safe, not the module's restricted `performCall`. The CLI
`scripts/lighter/lagoon-lighter-change-pubkey.py` **prints the transaction**
(To / value / Data + ABI) to paste into the Safe{Wallet} **Transaction
Builder**, where the owners co-sign. The `eth_defi.lighter.pubkey` helpers
(`validate_lighter_pubkey`, `encode_change_pubkey`,
`build_change_pubkey_safe_tx`, and `execute_change_pubkey` for a single-owner
Safe) back it.

## Operator setup (Python)

```python
from eth_defi.lighter.deployment import (
    LighterDeployment,
    setup_lighter_whitelisting,
)

setup_lighter_whitelisting(
    web3=web3,
    module=module,                      # TradingStrategyModuleV0 / GuardV0
    owner=safe_address,
    deployment=LighterDeployment.create_ethereum(),
    safe_address=safe_address,          # allowReceiver(safe)
)
```

`setup_lighter_whitelisting()` reads the USDC asset index from the ZkLighter
contract (`USDC_ASSET_INDEX()`) and calls `whitelistLighter(zkLighter, usdc,
usdcAssetIndex, notes)` + `allowReceiver(safe)` (preferably batched via
`multicall`). It lives in
`eth_defi/lighter/deployment.py` (the production module) and is also called by
the Lagoon vault deployment flow (`eth_defi/erc_4626/vault_protocol/lagoon/
deployment.py`) when a `lighter_deployment` is configured. The Anvil-fork
tests reuse the same function.

## Limitations (current scope)

- **Ethereum deployment only.** The configured `ZkLighter` proxy, USDC token,
  Safe whitelisting, API-key rotation and example flows all target Ethereum
  mainnet. The deployment-aware native-pool metrics pipeline does not make
  these custody helpers multi-chain.
- **USDC-only.** A single deposit asset (USDC) is whitelisted; its asset index
  is read from `ZkLighter.USDC_ASSET_INDEX()`. Additional assets are not
  supported yet — `whitelistLighter` takes one `assetIndex` per call (each call
  adds to `LighterLib.allowedAssetIndices`), and there is no multi-asset
  convenience helper or multicall batching like
  `setup_hypercore_whitelisting`.
- **Deposit / withdraw only.** On-book trading (`createOrder`) and trading-key
  rotation (`changePubKey`) are out of guard scope; trading happens off-chain
  via the Lighter L2 API. See the manual tutorial
  `scripts/lagoon/lagoon-lighter-example.py` for the end-to-end lifecycle
  (the off-chain trading steps cannot be simulated on a fork, like GMX keepers).

## Deployment note (library linking)

`LighterLib` is an external library: it must be **deployed and linked** into the
guard/module at deployment time, exactly like `GmxLib` and `HypercoreVaultLib`
(passed via `deploy_contract(..., libraries={"LighterLib": <addr>, ...})`).

## Manual test recipe

On an Anvil **Ethereum mainnet fork** (this guard integration targets Lighter's
Ethereum L1 custody contract):

1. Deploy the guard with `LighterLib` linked; run `setup_lighter_whitelisting`
   (`whitelistLighter(zkLighter, usdc, usdcAssetIndex, notes)` + `allowReceiver(safe)`).
2. Assert `validateCall` accepts `approve`, `deposit(safe, USDC_ASSET_INDEX, …)`,
   `withdraw(accountIndex, USDC_ASSET_INDEX, …)`,
   `withdrawPendingBalance(safe, USDC_ASSET_INDEX, …)`.
3. Assert `validateCall` reverts on `deposit(attacker, …)`,
   `deposit(safe, WRONG_ASSET_INDEX, …)`, `withdrawPendingBalance(attacker, …)`,
   `changePubKey(…)` (not in scope), and any non-whitelisted selector.
