    - Uses a thread worker pool for concurrency

    - Even though we receive data from JSON-RPC API in random order,
      the iterable results are always in the correct order (and processes in a single thread)

    - Returns events as a dict for optimal performance

    - Can resume scan

    - Supports interactive progress bar

    - Reads all the events matching signature - any filtering must be done
      by the reader

    See `scripts/read-uniswap-v2-pairs-and-swaps-concurrent.py` for a full example.
