class MultithreadEventReader(Web3EventReader):
    """Multithreaded and parallel Solidity event reading.

    - A high performance event reader for JSON-RPC APIs

    - Uses parallel requests, but the consumer will always get the events in the order
      they have happened on-chain

    - This class wraps around lower level event reading functions to
      simpler to use and well-documented example.

    - It is designed to be used standalone (you read the events)

    - It is designed to be passed to the functions that expect :py:class:`Web3EventReader` protocol

    See :ref:`multithread-reader` for full tutorial.

    Example how to read events:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Get one of the contracts prepackaged ABIs from eth_defi package
        value_interpreter_contract = get_contract(web3, "enzyme/ValueInterpreter.json")

        # Read events only for this contract
        # See https://docs.enzyme.finance/developers/contracts/polygon
        target_contract_address = "0x66De7e286Aae66f7f3Daf693c22d16EEa48a0f45"

        # Create eth_getLogs event filtering
        filter = Filter.create_filter(
            target_contract_address,
            [value_interpreter_contract.events.PrimitiveAdded],
        )

        # Set up multithreaded Polygon event reader.
        # Print progress to the console how many blocks there are left to read.
        reader = MultithreadEventReader(
            json_rpc_url,
            max_threads=16,
            notify=PrintProgressUpdate(),
            max_blocks_once=10_000,
        )

        # Loop over the events as the multihreaded reader pool is feeding them to us.
        # Events will always arrive in the order they happened on chain.
        decoded_events = []
        start = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        for event in reader(
            web3,
            start_block,
            end_block,
            filter=filter,
        ):
            # Decode the solidity event
            #
            # Indexed event parameters go to EVM topics, the second element is the first parameter
            # Non-indexed event parameters go to EVM arguments, first element is the first parameter
            arguments = decode_data(event["data"])
            topics = event["topics"]

            # event PrimitiveAdded(
            #     address indexed primitive,
            #     address aggregator,
            #     RateAsset rateAsset,
            #     uint256 unit
            # );
            primitive = convert_uint256_bytes_to_address(HexBytes(topics[1]))
            aggregator = convert_uint256_bytes_to_address(arguments[0])
            rate_asset = convert_int256_bytes_to_int(arguments[1])
            unit = convert_int256_bytes_to_int(arguments[2])

            # Primitive is a ERC-20 token, resolve its name and symbol while we are decoded the events
            token = fetch_erc20_details(web3, primitive)

            decoded = {
                "primitive": primitive,
                "aggregator": aggregator,
                "rate_asset": rate_asset,
                "unit": unit,
                "token": token,
            }

    Example how to pass the multithread reader to a function consuming events:

    .. code-block:: python

        provider = cast(HTTPProvider, web3.provider)
        json_rpc_url = provider.endpoint_uri
        reader = MultithreadEventReader(json_rpc_url, max_threads=16)

        start_block = 1
        end_block = web3.eth.block_number

        # Iterate over all price feed added events
        # over the whole blockchain range
        feed_iter = fetch_price_feeds(
            deployment,
            start_block,
            end_block,
            reader,
        )
        feeds = list(feed_iter)
        reader.close()
        assert len(feeds) == 2

    Because Ethereum does not have native JSON-RPC API to get block timestamps and headers
    easily, there are many work arounds how to get timestamps for events.
    Here is an example how to fetch timestamps "lazily" only for blocks
    where you have events:

    .. code-block:: python

        from eth_defi.event_reader.lazy_timestamp_reader import extract_timestamps_json_rpc_lazy

        provider = cast(HTTPProvider, web3.provider)
        json_rpc_url = provider.endpoint_uri
        reader = MultithreadEventReader(json_rpc_url, max_threads=16)

        start_block = 1
        end_block = web3.eth.block_number

        reader = MultithreadEventReader(
            json_rpc_url,
        )

        for log_result in reader(
            web3,
            restored_start_block,
            end_block,
            filter=filter,
            extract_timestamps=extract_timestamps_json_rpc_lazy,
        ):
            pass

    See :py:func:`eth_defi.event_reader.lazy_timestamp_reader.extract_timestamps_json_rpc_lazy`
    and :py:func:`eth_defi.uniswap_v3.events.fetch_events_to_csv` for more details.
