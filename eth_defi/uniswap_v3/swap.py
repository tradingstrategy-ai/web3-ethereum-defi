    Uniswap v3 has the same trading pair deployed multiple times as multiple pools
    with different fee tiers. `Use DEX and trading pair search to figure out fee tiers <https://tradingstrategy.ai/search>`__.

    the estimated amounts. This would allow to estimate
    historical slippages.

        The default is 15 BPS (0.15%)
