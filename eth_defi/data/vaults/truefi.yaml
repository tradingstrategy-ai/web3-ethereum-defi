long_description: |
  TrueFi is DeFi's first and largest credit protocol, connecting lenders, borrowers, and portfolio
  managers via smart contracts governed by the TRU token. Lenders enjoy predictable, transparent
  yields on real-world and crypto-native lending. Borrowers and portfolio managers get access to
  competitively priced capital with no collateral lockup.

  Since its launch in November 2020, TrueFi has originated more than $1.7bn in loans to over 30
  borrowers and paid more than $40mm in interest to protocol participants. Borrowers include both
  leading crypto-focused institutions and real-world firms, such as fintech companies, trading
  firms, and credit funds.
