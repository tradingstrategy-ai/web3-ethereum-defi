  Non-custodial lending primitive creating programmable risk-isolated markets.
long_description: |
  The Silo Protocol is a non-custodial lending primitive that creates programmable risk-isolated markets
  known as silos. Any user with a wallet can lend or borrow in a silo in a non-custodial manner. Silo
  markets use the peer-to-pool, overcollateralised model, where the value of a borrower's collateral
  always exceeds the value of their loan.

  Unlike traditional lending protocols where all assets share risk in a common pool, Silo creates
  separate, isolated lending pools for each supported asset. Each Silo is composed of the unique
  asset for which it was created and bridge assets (ETH, USDC). Silo V2 supports ERC-4626 integration
  for seamless compatibility with third-party DeFi applications.
