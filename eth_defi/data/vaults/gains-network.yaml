  Automated market making vaults for perpetual futures trading on-chain.
long_description: |
  GToken-based vault smart contracts provide automated market making vaults for perpetual futures
  purely on-chain. The trading engine uses gToken vaults for all trading pairs, making it over
  100x more capital efficient than traditional order book approaches.

  Known implementations are:

  - gTrade, formerly known as Gains protocol and its gToken vaults
  - Ostium vaults, also known as "Ostium LP" vaults where LP stands for liquidity provider

  This Python-based API allows you to automate interactions with these vaults in your application:

  - Discover vaults and their features across multiple chains
  - Historical data reading: share price, profit, TVL, deposits, redemptions
  - Deposit into a vault from your application
  - Redeem from the vault
  - Query your vault positions
  - Query vault redemption delays
