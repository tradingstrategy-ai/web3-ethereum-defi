  Open-source interest rate derivatives protocol enabling yield tokenisation.
long_description: |
  Spectra is an open-source interest rate derivatives protocol that enables yield tokenisation.
  The protocol splits ERC-4626 compliant interest-bearing tokens into Principal Tokens (PT) and
  Yield Tokens (YT), allowing users to fix rates, trade yield, and earn on liquidity positions.

  The current integration supports the Spectra ERC-4626 wrapper for WUSDN (Wrapped Ultimate
  Synthetic Delta Neutral), which is a wrapper contract that makes WUSDN compatible with
  Spectra's yield tokenisation system.

  **Note:** This wrapper is NOT a core Spectra yield tokenisation vault. It is an ERC-4626
  wrapper that enables WUSDN to be used within Spectra's PT/YT system.

  WUSDN is a non-rebasing wrapper around USDN, a decentralised synthetic US dollar from
  SmarDex that uses a delta-neutral strategy to generate yield.
