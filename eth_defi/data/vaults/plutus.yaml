long_description: |
  PLUTUS is the cross-chain yield- and governance layer backing the Plutus protocol and ecosystem.

  The yield-bearing and vote-enabling escrowed version xPLUTUS is made available on each chain
  PLUTUS, the LayerZero OFT, is deployed on.

  Plutus buys back PLUTUS using revenue and productive treasury funds and distributes this
  PLUTUS-denominated real yield to xPLUTUS stakers, thus funnelling circulating supply to
  those most aligned with the protocol.
