long_description: |
  Term Finance is a noncustodial fixed-rate liquidity protocol modelled on tri-party
  repo arrangements common in traditional finance (TradFi). Liquidity suppliers and
  takers are matched through a unique weekly auction process where liquidity takers
  submit bids and suppliers submit offers to the protocol.

  The protocol determines a "market clearing rate" that matches supply and demand.
  Bidders who bid more than the clearing rate receive loans and lenders asking less
  than the clearing rate supply liquidity.

  Key features:

  - Fixed-rate DeFi lending and borrowing via auctions
  - Scalable transactions with no spread, no slippage, and low fees
  - Collateral sits in isolated noncustodial smart contracts (repoLocker)
  - No rehypothecation - collateral cannot be lent to other borrowers
