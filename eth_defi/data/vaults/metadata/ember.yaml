long_description: |
  Ember is the investment platform and infrastructure for launching, accessing,
  and distributing traditional and onchain financial products through crypto capital markets.
  The protocol enables issuers to tokenise and distribute products while providing investors
  access to yield-bearing vaults through a unified interface.

  Ember vaults operate on Ethereum and Sui. They follow ERC-4626 principles but use custom events:
  VaultDeposit instead of the standard Deposit event, and RequestRedeemed/RequestProcessed instead
  of the standard Withdraw event. Withdrawals go through a pending queue with typical T+4 settlement.
fee_description: |
  Ember curators set their own management fee (annualised % of AUM, accrued continuously)
  and performance fee (% of positive performance, collected monthly). Both fees are
  internalised in the vault share price — there are no separate deductions on deposit
  or withdrawal. Fee parameters are not readable on-chain but are displayed in the vault UI.
