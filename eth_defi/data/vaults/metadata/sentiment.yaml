  Decentralised onchain lending protocol with isolated pools and SuperPool vault aggregators.
long_description: |
  Sentiment is a decentralised onchain lending protocol that enables users to programmatically
  lend and borrow digital assets on Ethereum and L2 chains. The protocol features isolated
  pools for risk management, allowing lenders to choose their risk exposure.

  The protocol uses a SuperPool architecture where deposits are aggregated across multiple
  underlying lending pools. SuperPools are ERC-4626 compliant vault aggregators that manage
  deposits with configurable allocation strategies controlled by allocators.

  Key features:

  - **Isolated pools**: Each pool has its own risk parameters and collateral requirements
  - **SuperPools**: ERC-4626 vault aggregators that diversify deposits across multiple pools
  - **Configurable fees**: Fees taken from interest earned, paid to fee recipients
  - **Allocator system**: Third-party operators can manage pool allocations
fee_description: |
  Sentiment SuperPools charge a fee on interest earned. The fee is expressed as a value out of
  1e18, where 1e18 represents 100%. When interest accrues, new shares are minted to the fee
  recipient proportional to the configured fee rate.
