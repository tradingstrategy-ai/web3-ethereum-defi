short_description: |
  Native perpetual trading vaults on Hyperliquid's HyperCore layer.
long_description: |
  Hyperliquid vaults are core primitives within HyperCore that enable strategy
  deployment using the same infrastructure as the Hyperliquid DEX, including
  liquidation mechanisms and high-frequency trading capabilities.

  Anyone can deposit into a vault to earn a share of the profits from the vault
  leader's trading strategy. Vaults can be managed by individual traders or
  operated as automated market makers (e.g. the Hyperliquidity Provider, HLP).

  All strategies carry their own risk profile. Users should conduct due diligence
  on vault performance history before depositing.

  Key features:

  - Vault leaders deploy perpetual trading strategies on HyperCore
  - Depositors earn 90% of profits; vault leaders receive 10% profit share
  - Protocol vaults (e.g. HLP) have no fees or profit sharing
  - Same infrastructure as the DEX — liquidation engine, high-frequency execution
  - All vaults denominated in USDC
fee_description: |
  Vault leaders receive a fixed 10% profit share from depositor profits, deducted
  at withdrawal time. Protocol-managed vaults (e.g. HLP, HLP Strategy A/B) carry
  no fees or profit sharing.
