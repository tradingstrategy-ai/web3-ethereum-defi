  Decentralised stablecoin protocol on Avalanche with yield-bearing assets
long_description: |
  Avant Protocol is a decentralised finance platform on Avalanche that offers on-chain yield-bearing assets through an adaptive multi-manager architecture. The protocol deploys capital across delta-neutral strategies managed by specialised strategy teams.

  The protocol offers avUSD, a stablecoin that can be staked to receive savUSD (Staked avUSD). savUSD is an ERC-4626 vault token that earns yield from the protocol's reward distribution mechanism with an 8-hour vesting period for distributed rewards.

  Key features include multi-layer security with reserve funds and junior tranches for loss protection, a transparent dashboard for capital allocation reporting, and risk-tiered options through senior and junior tranches. The protocol also supports avBTC and avETH products with corresponding boosted yield versions.

fee_description: |
  Avant Protocol does not charge management or performance fees at the smart contract level. Yield is distributed through the protocol's reward mechanism and vested over 8 hours. A configurable cooldown period may be required for withdrawals, controlled by governance.
