short_description: |
  On-chain fractional reserve banking protocol with transparent yield distribution.
long_description: |
  infiniFi is a DeFi protocol that recreates fractional reserve banking on-chain on Ethereum.
  The protocol enables users to deposit stablecoins to mint iUSD receipt tokens, which can
  then be staked for yield through siUSD (liquid staking) or liUSD (locked staking).

  By merging liquid and illiquid assets into a capital-efficient system with transparent
  fractional reserves, infiniFi delivers superior yields to depositors. The protocol
  allocates capital into yield strategies through integrations with Aave, Pendle, Fluid,
  and Ethena, while maintaining reserves for redemptions.

  In case of losses, the protocol has an explicit waterfall mechanism: locked liUSD
  holders absorb losses first, then siUSD stakers, and finally plain iUSD holders.
  This provides different risk/reward profiles for users based on their preferences.

  The protocol was founded in 2024 and raised $3 million in pre-seed funding from
  investors including Electric Capital, New Form Capital, Axiom, and Kraynos Capital.

  infiniFi's fee structure is not publicly documented in detail. The protocol uses
  epoch-based reward distribution to smooth yield over time.
