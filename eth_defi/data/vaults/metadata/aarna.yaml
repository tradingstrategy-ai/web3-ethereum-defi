  Agentic Onchain Treasury (AOT) protocol using AI agents for DeFi management.
long_description: |
  aarnâ develops an Agentic Onchain Treasury (AOT), a fully autonomous onchain treasury
  that allocates, rotates, and secures assets through programmable, transparent agent governance.
  The system uses AI agents (âTARS) to manage decentralised finance complexity without requiring
  users to navigate DeFi themselves.

  Key features:

  - **Agent Architecture**: Multi-agent system with specialised roles for yield analysis and trade execution
  - **Non-custodial**: Users maintain control with assets remaining in their own wallets
  - **Tokenised Vaults (âtv series)**: Structured exposure to various asset classes via ERC-4626 compliant vaults
  - **Multi-chain**: Deployed across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Sonic networks
  - **Governance Token ($AARNA)**: Powers staking, incentives, and policy updates through onchain voting

  The platform's vaults operate through autonomous agents that analyse market conditions
  and execute allocation strategies. Core contracts are independently audited by FailSafe
  and CertiK, and monitored for security.
