  Blockchain-based protocol connecting global borrowers and lenders through standardised lending.
long_description: |
  cSigma Finance is a blockchain-based protocol that connects global borrowers and lenders
  by standardising and streamlining the commercial lending process. The protocol offers
  crypto-uncorrelated yield opportunities to stablecoin holders through tokenised real-world
  assets (RWA) and risk-adjusted DeFi strategies.

  csUSD allows users to deposit stablecoins and earn yield from two sources:
  RWA credit markets and on-chain DeFi yield strategies. The protocol dynamically
  allocates between these sources based on market conditions to optimise yield performance.

  As of Q1 2025, cSigma Finance has tokenised over $80 million in business loans from
  mid-market companies across the United States, European Union, and Asia. The tokenised
  loans are accessible on 11 major blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB.
