  Delta-neutral stablecoin protocol with wstUSR wrapped staking vault.
long_description: |
  Resolv is a protocol that maintains USR, a stablecoin fully backed by ETH and BTC
  and pegged to the US Dollar. The stablecoin's delta-neutral design ensures price
  stability, and is backed by an innovative insurance pool (RLP) to provide additional
  security and overcollateralisation.

  **About the vault**: The wstUSR (Wrapped stUSR) vault is an ERC-4626 compliant wrapper around the rebasing
  stUSR (staked USR) token. stUSR is a yield-bearing token that automatically compounds
  returns generated from the basis trade. wstUSR provides a non-rebasing representation
  of stUSR, making it suitable for DeFi integrations that don't support rebasing tokens.
