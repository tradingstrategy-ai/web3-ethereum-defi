long_description: |
  Accountable Capital develops blockchain-based financial verification technology that enables
  organisations and investors to demonstrate solvency, liquidity, and compliance through
  transparent, verifiable attestations. The platform combines cryptographic proofs with
  auditable financial data to enhance trust across Web3 and traditional finance.

  Accountable vaults implement the ERC-7540 async redemption pattern with a queue system
  for processing withdrawal requests. The protocol is primarily deployed on Monad blockchain.
