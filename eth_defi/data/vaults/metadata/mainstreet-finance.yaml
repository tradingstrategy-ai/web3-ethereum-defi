  Synthetic USD stablecoin ecosystem with options arbitrage yield strategies.
long_description: |
  Mainstreet Finance is a synthetic USD stablecoin ecosystem built on multi-asset
  collateralisation on the Sonic blockchain. The protocol delivers institutional-grade
  delta-neutral yield strategies through a dual-token system - msUSD (the synthetic
  stablecoin) and smsUSD (the staked version that earns yield from options arbitrage
  strategies).

  Users deposit USDC to mint msUSD, which can then be staked into smsUSD to earn
  yield. The underlying collateral is deployed into CME index box spreads and options
  arbitrage strategies, with profits distributed to smsUSD holders
  The details on the [the options box spread strategy are here.](https://mainstreet-finance.gitbook.io/mainstreet.finance/msusd-and-strategy-vaults/strategy-vaults/msy-the-options-box-spread)
  The yield in box spreads is driven by retail investor behavior in the options market.

  - Dual-token system: msUSD (non-yield-bearing) and smsUSD (yield-bearing)
  - Yield from institutional-grade options arbitrage strategies
  - Cross-chain functionality via LayerZero OFT standard
