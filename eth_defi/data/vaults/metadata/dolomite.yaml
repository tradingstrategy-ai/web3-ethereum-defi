  Next-generation DeFi lending and borrowing platform supporting over 1,000 unique assets.
long_description: |
  Dolomite is a next-generation DeFi lending and borrowing platform built on Arbitrum
  that supports over 1,000 unique assets with capital-efficient money markets. The protocol
  allows users to lend, borrow, trade, margin, and hedge various crypto assets with greater
  capital efficiency and broader asset support than traditional protocols.

  Dolomite ERC-4626 vaults wrap user margin positions into standard ERC-4626 tokenised
  vault shares, enabling seamless integration with other DeFi protocols. These vaults
  support features like collateralisation for borrowing and integration with external
  yield-bearing assets.

  Key features:

  - Yield accrues from lending in Dolomite money markets
  - No explicit deposit/withdrawal fees at the vault level
  - Fees are internalised through interest rate spreads
  - Instant deposits and withdrawals (subject to market liquidity)
  - Chainlink Automation secures price updates for vault assets
  - Support for over 1,000 unique assets
fee_description: |
  Dolomite has no explicit deposit/withdrawal fees at the vault level. Fees are internalised
  through interest rate spreads between borrowers and lenders. The protocol earns from
  the difference between borrowing and lending rates.
