short_description: |
  Decentralised yield optimisation platform with multi-chain asset allocation.
long_description: |
  Yo is a decentralised yield optimisation platform that automatically allocates user assets
  across multiple DeFi protocols and blockchains to maximise risk-adjusted returns. The platform
  uses algorithmic balancing powered by Exponential.fi's risk ratings to optimise yield while
  managing exposure, and continuously rebalances to maintain optimal positioning.

  The YoVault_V2 is an ERC-4626 compliant vault with an asynchronous redemption mechanism.
  Users can deposit assets and request redemptions which are fulfilled by operators, enabling
  cross-chain asset management. The vault integrates with over 40 DeFi protocols including
  Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Curve, Lido, Morpho, and Pendle.
fee_description: |
  Yo vaults have configurable deposit and withdrawal fees that are set by the operators.
  The fees are applied at the time of deposit or redemption. There are no separate
  management or performance fees.
