  Onchain options protocol with AI-managed yield vaults on Base.
long_description: |
  BaseVol is an onchain options protocol on Base, offering zero-day-to-expiry (0DTE)
  binary options trading and AI-managed yield vaults. The protocol was incubated by
  Base (Batch #001, 2nd place global) and raised $3M in a seed round led by
  Neoclassic Capital, joined by Virtuals Ventures and Baboon VC.

  The Genesis Vault systematically deploys funds using a 90/10 allocation: 90% to
  USDC lending on Morpho/Spark, and 10% to 0DTE options selling. The vault is managed
  by A.T.M. (Autonomous Trading Machine), an AI agent that handles trade sizing,
  hedging, and settlement.

  Vault types:

  - Genesis Vault (gVAULT) - neutral market strategy
  - High Vol Vault (gVAULT-over101-under99) - high volatility strategy
  - 99 Over Vault (gVAULT-over99) - directional strategy
  - 101 Under Vault (gVAULT-under101) - directional strategy

  The vaults use Diamond proxy (EIP-2535) architecture with multiple facets.
