short_description: |
  Next-generation DeFi lending protocol with capital-efficient money markets across multiple chains.
long_description: |
  Curvance is a cross-chain DeFi lending protocol that enables users to deposit collateral, borrow
  assets, and participate in yield optimisation strategies through a non-custodial architecture.

  The protocol features risk-isolated, intent-based lending markets that blend elements of shared
  pools and isolated markets. This enables flexible risk management, higher loan-to-value ratios
  for safer assets, and innovative lending opportunities tailored to different DeFi strategies.

  Key features include auto-compounding vaults, one-click looping for maximised capital efficiency,
  and dual oracle protection for accurate pricing. Curvance is deployed on Monad, Ethereum,
  Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon zkEVM, and Blast.
fee_description: |
  Curvance uses an interest-based fee model rather than explicit deposit/withdrawal fees:

  - **Interest fee**: The protocol takes a percentage (up to 60%) of borrower interest payments.
    This is the primary revenue source and does not directly reduce depositor returns.
  - **Flashloan fee**: 0.04% (4 basis points) on flash loan amounts.
  - **No management or performance fees**: Depositors do not pay explicit fees on their deposits.
