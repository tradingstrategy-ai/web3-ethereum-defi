  Institutional-grade DeFi yield strategies through non-custodial vaults.
long_description: |
  Upshift democratises institutional-grade DeFi yield strategies through non-custodial vaults
  built on August infrastructure. The platform handles three main product offerings:

  **Upshift Lend**: An on-chain lending platform providing overcollateralised positions
  with institutional borrowers, emphasising KYC/KYB verification and real yield opportunities.

  **Upshift DeFi Yield**: Access to yield strategies curated and executed by some of the
  best-performing DeFi funds, offering institutional-level risk management previously
  unavailable to retail participants.

  **Vault-as-a-Service (VaaS)**: A streamlined solution for ecosystems and protocols
  looking to offer tailored vault opportunities, utilising the ERC-4626 standard alongside
  August smart contracts.

  The vaults operate as non-custodial structures, meaning users maintain control over their assets.
  The implementation leverages the ERC-4626 Vault Standard, a widely-adopted Ethereum standard
  for tokenised vaults.
