  Curve Finance's lending protocol with soft-liquidation protection.
long_description: |
  Llama Lend is Curve Finance's lending protocol powered by the liquidation protection mechanism
  provided by LLAMMA (Lending Liquidating Automated Market Maker Algorithm).

  LLAMMA is the market-making contract that rebalances the collateral of a loan. It is an algorithm
  implemented into a smart contract which is responsible for liquidating and de-liquidating collateral
  based on market conditions through arbitrage traders. Each individual market has its own AMM
  containing the collateral and borrowable asset.

  Based on the collateral provided, LLAMMA fixes specific price bands to liquidate portions of the
  collateral rather than liquidating fully at a specific liquidation price, enabling soft liquidations.
