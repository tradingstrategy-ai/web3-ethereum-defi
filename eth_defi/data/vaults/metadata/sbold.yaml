  Yield-bearing tokenised representation of deposits into Liquity V2 Stability Pools.
long_description: |
  sBOLD is a yield-bearing stablecoin that aggregates and tokenises the stability pools of
  Liquity V2, automatically hedging liquidation premiums. It serves as a passive non-custodial
  savings account for BOLD token holders.

  The vault deposits BOLD across multiple stability pools:
  - wstETH pool (60% initial allocation)
  - rETH pool (30% initial allocation)
  - wETH pool (10% initial allocation)

  Yield is generated from:
  - Interest distributions from borrowers paid to stability pools
  - Liquidation penalties through automated collateral swaps

  sBOLD is developed by K3 Capital, a DeFi-focused organisation managing over $570M in assets
  since 2021.
fee_description: |
  sBOLD has configurable fee mechanisms:
  - Entry fee: Configurable, initially set to 0%
  - Swap rewards: Admin-configurable basis points paid to fee receiver when collateral is swapped
  - Swap fees: Configurable, initially set to 0%

  There are no management or performance fees. Yield accrues directly through stability pool
  rewards which are internalised into the share price.
