  Ostium is a self-custodial leveraged trading platform for perpetual swaps on real-world assets
  (RWAs) including stocks, indices, commodities, and FX. Built on Arbitrum, Ostium uses gToken-based
  vault smart contracts that provide automated market making vaults for perpetual futures purely
  on-chain.

  liquidity provider) for all trading pairs, making it over 100x more capital efficient than
  traditional order book approaches.

  Key features:

  - ERC-4626 compatible vaults for perpetual futures liquidity provision
  - Self-custodial trading on real-world assets
  - Capital efficient automated market making for perpetual swaps
  - Epoch-based withdrawal system for managing redemptions
