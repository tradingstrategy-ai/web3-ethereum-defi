  Decentralised stablecoin and lending protocol with Fraxlend lending pairs.
long_description: |
  Frax Finance is a decentralised finance protocol that originated as the first fractional-algorithmic
  stablecoin. The protocol has evolved into a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem encompassing stablecoins
  (FRAX/frxUSD), liquid staking derivatives (frxETH/sfrxETH), lending markets (Fraxlend),
  an automated market maker (Fraxswap), and its own Layer 2 chain (Fraxtal).

  Fraxlend is the lending component of Frax Finance, providing isolated lending pairs where lenders
  deposit assets and earn variable interest from borrowers. Each Fraxlend pair is an ERC-4626 compatible
  vault with its own collateral type, interest rate model, and risk parameters. The protocol uses
  Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs) to perform autonomous market operations and maintain stablecoin pegs.

  With Frax v3, the protocol moved to 100% collateralisation, removing dependence on USDC.
  Governance is handled through Frax Shares (FXS) and a vetokenomics model (veFXS).
fee_description: |
  Fraxlend takes 10% of interest revenue as a protocol fee (via the `feeToProtocolRate` parameter).
  This fee is internalised in the share price and not charged to lenders directly on deposit or withdrawal.
  Lenders receive the net yield after the protocol fee is deducted from borrower interest.
