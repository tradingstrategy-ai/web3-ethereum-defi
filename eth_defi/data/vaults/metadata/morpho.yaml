short_description: |
  Decentralised lending protocol with optimised interest rates and flexible vault architectures.
long_description: |
  Morpho is a decentralised lending protocol that enables peer-to-peer lending with optimised
  interest rates. The protocol matches lenders and borrowers directly when possible, allowing
  both parties to benefit from improved rates compared to traditional lending pools.

  Morpho offers two major vault versions:

  - **Morpho V1 (MetaMorpho)**: The original Morpho vault architecture that directly integrates
    with Morpho markets. These vaults are identified by the `MORPHO()` function.

  - **Morpho V2**: A newer adapter-based architecture that enables flexible allocation across
    multiple yield sources through smart contract adapters. V2 vaults support:

    - Multi-protocol yield allocation via adapters
    - Granular ID & Cap system for risk management
    - Performance fees (up to 50%) and management fees (up to 5%)
    - Timelocked governance with curator/allocator roles
    - Non-custodial exits via `forceDeallocate`

  Key features:

  - Permissionless market creation with customisable risk parameters
  - Multiple curated vault strategies from leading risk managers
  - Institutional-grade security with multiple audits
  - Deployed across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and other chains
fee_description: |
  Morpho vaults have two fee types:

  - **Performance fee**: Up to 50% on generated yield, taken when interest accrues
  - **Management fee**: Up to 5% per year on total assets under management

  Fees are internalised into the share price through share minting to fee recipients.
  Individual vaults may have different fee configurations set by their curators.
