long_description: |
  Brink is a DeFi protocol that provides yield-bearing vaults on Mantle and other chains.
  The protocol focuses on delivering sustainable yield through optimised DeFi strategies
  while maintaining simplicity for users.

  Brink vaults are ERC-4626 compliant but use modified events (DepositFunds and WithdrawFunds)
  instead of the standard ERC-4626 Deposit and Withdraw events. Fees are internalised in the
  share price with no explicit fee getter functions exposed on-chain.
