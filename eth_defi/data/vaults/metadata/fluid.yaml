  DeFi liquidity layer by Instadapp with ERC-4626 compliant fToken lending vaults.
long_description: |
  Fluid is a comprehensive DeFi liquidity layer by Instadapp that combines lending, borrowing,
  and decentralised exchange capabilities. At its core is the Liquidity Layer, which consolidates
  capital across built-on protocols, eliminating the need for individual protocols to independently
  attract liquidity.

  The ecosystem consists of multiple interconnected protocols:

  - **Lending Protocol**: Simple deposit-and-earn system via ERC-4626 compliant fTokens that
    represent user stakes and accrue interest over time through the exchange price mechanism.

  - **Vault Protocol**: Advanced borrowing system with high LTV ratios (up to 95%) and low
    liquidation penalties for capital-efficient collateralised debt positions.

  - **DEX Protocol**: Decentralised exchange built on top of the Liquidity Layer with Smart
    collateral and Smart debt features, allowing users to earn LP fees on collateral or
    borrowed positions.

  The protocol is deployed across multiple chains including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Plasma.
fee_description: |
  Fluid fTokens have fees internalised through the exchange price mechanism. Interest accrues to
  the share price over time, and there are no explicit deposit or withdrawal fees.

  The protocol earns revenue through interest rate spreads between lending and borrowing rates,
  which are built into the liquidity layer's pricing mechanism.
