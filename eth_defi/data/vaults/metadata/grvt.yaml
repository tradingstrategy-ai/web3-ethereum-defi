  Native perpetual trading strategies on Gravity Markets (GRVT).
long_description: |
  GRVT (Gravity Markets) is a hybrid derivatives exchange built on a
  ZKsync-based chain. Strategy vaults allow managers to
  deploy perpetual trading strategies while depositors earn a share of
  the returns.

  All vaults are denominated in USDT. Investor positions are updated
  every 4 hours, which acts as a practical settlement/lockup period.

  Key features:

  - Strategy managers deploy perpetual trading strategies on GRVT
  - Management fees range from 0% to 4%, charged daily via share minting
  - Performance fees range from 0% to 40%, charged at redemption
  - 4-hour position update interval (settlement period)
  - All vaults denominated in USDT
fee_description: |
  Management fees (0-4%) are charged daily by minting new strategy shares,
  diluting existing holders. These fees are already reflected in the share
  price. Performance fees (0-40%) are charged on gains at redemption time
  and are not reflected in the share price (externalised). Each vault sets
  its own fee percentages.
