  Web3 asset management platform deploying capital into risk-managed DeFi strategies.
long_description: |
  YieldFi is an asset management platform for the onchain economy. The protocol actively
  deploys capital into risk-managed, high-performing DeFi strategies across stablecoins,
  ETH, and BTC asset classes.

  The platform uses vyToken vaults (e.g., vyUSD) that implement ERC-4626 with additional
  features including configurable vesting periods for reward distribution and guardrail
  mechanisms for risk management.

  YieldFi aims to provide streamlined Web3 asset management for users seeking simplified
  access to yield-generating DeFi opportunities.
fee_description: |
  YieldFi vaults have configurable fees via the setFee() function. The fee structure
  is protocol-determined and may vary by vault.
