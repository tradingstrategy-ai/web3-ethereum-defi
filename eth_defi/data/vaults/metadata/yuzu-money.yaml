long_description: |
  Yuzu Money is a DeFi protocol that packages high-yield strategies into an overcollateralised
  stablecoin (yzUSD). The protocol is deployed on the Plasma chain and offers multiple products
  for users seeking yield on their stablecoin holdings.

  The protocol features a multi-token architecture:

  - **yzUSD**: Overcollateralised stablecoin targeting $1 USD, backed 1:1 by USDC
  - **syzUSD**: Yield-bearing token received when staking yzUSD (ERC-4626 vault)
  - **yzPP**: Junior tranche / insurance liquidity pool providing first-loss capital

  Key features:

  - Institutional-grade risk mitigation with risk tranching
  - Nexus Mutual smart contract insurance coverage
  - Hypernative threat monitoring
  - Real-time Proof of Reserves dashboard
  - Audited by Pashov Audit Group
fee_description: |
  Yuzu Money does not charge traditional performance fees. Instead, the protocol employs a
  yield-smoothing mechanism where a consistent weekly yield target is distributed to users,
  backed by a Reserve Fund that acts as a buffer. This approach provides more predictable
  returns without explicit management or performance fees.
