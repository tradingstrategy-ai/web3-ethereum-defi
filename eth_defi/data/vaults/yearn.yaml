long_description: |
  Yearn Vaults (yVaults) are capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities
  present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socialising gas costs, automating the yield generation
  and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users do not
  need extensive knowledge of the underlying DeFi protocols and can use the vaults as passive-investing
  strategies.

  With yVaults v3, vaults can be made from a single strategy or a collection of multiple strategies
  which balance funds between them. Users have more control over where they want their funds to go
  and a wider range of risk appetites.
