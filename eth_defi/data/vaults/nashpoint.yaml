  Smart contract protocol enabling asset managers to create diversified investment products on-chain.
long_description: |
  NashPoint is a smart contract protocol that enables asset managers (Owners) to independently create
  and manage diversified investment products on-chain. Each investment product, or Node, encapsulates
  a customised strategy defined by selecting underlying assets (components), setting management fees,
  determining reserve ratios, establishing rebalancing frequency, and specifying acceptable tracking
  error. Users deposit funds using the standardised ERC-4626 interface and withdraw asynchronously
  via ERC-7540, with all assets securely held within Node contracts.

  By bridging traditional Real-World Assets (RWAs) and crypto-native DeFi protocols, NashPoint offers
  comprehensive, diversified investment portfolios accessible through a unified interface. Nodes
  integrate effortlessly with prominent protocols such as Aave, Morpho, Ethena, Centrifuge, and Ondo.
  As ERC-20 compliant tokens, Nodes can be freely transferred, traded, or used as collateral across
  the broader DeFi ecosystem.

  NashPoint vaults are known as Node.
