  ETH Strategy is a DeFi treasury protocol that offers leveraged ETH exposure without risk of
  liquidation or volatility decay. It operates as Ethereum's first autonomous treasury protocol,
  designed to reimagine MicroStrategy's approach in a DeFi-native context.

  The ESPN (ETH Strategy Perpetual Note) vault is an ERC-4626 compliant vault that allows users
  to deposit USDS stablecoins. The protocol takes no fees on deposits or redemptions and is
  DAO-governed with rage quit functionality.
