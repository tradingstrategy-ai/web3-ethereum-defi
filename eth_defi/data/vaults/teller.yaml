  Decentralised lending protocol enabling long-tail lending pools with time-based loans.
long_description: |
  Teller Protocol is a decentralised lending protocol that enables long-tail
  lending pools where liquidity providers can deposit assets and earn yield
  from borrower interest payments.

  The protocol operates with a unique architecture that separates lending and
  borrowing into isolated pools with specific collateral/lending token pairs.
  Each pool has pre-set terms including collateralisation ratio, APR range,
  and maximum loan duration.

  Key features:

  - **Long-tail lending pools**: Each pool is isolated to a specific lending
    token and collateral token pair (e.g., USDC/TIBBIR)
  - **Time-based loans**: All loans on Teller are time-based instead of
    price-based. Price will never cause a loan to default, only expiration
  - **Liquidation auctions**: On default, collateral is transferred to a 24-hour
    Dutch auction where it is purchased to pay off the loan
  - **ERC-4626 compliant**: Lenders receive vault shares representing their stake
    in the pool
  - **TWAP pricing**: Uses Uniswap V3 TWAP for collateral price oracles

  The protocol is built on TellerV2 which handles the core lending mechanics,
  with LenderCommitmentGroup_Pool_V2 contract providing the ERC-4626 vault interface
  for pool-style lending.
