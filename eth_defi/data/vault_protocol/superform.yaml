  Permissionless cross-chain yield marketplace for DeFi protocols.
long_description: |
  Superform is a permissionless cross-chain yield marketplace designed for DeFi protocols, allowing
  them to list their vaults or asset pools. SuperVaults offer a simple way to get the best yields
  on-chain without needing to check rates or rebalance your portfolio.

  Interest is primarily generated through fixed-rate and variable-rate on-chain lending products.
  The Superform Protocol is a suite of non-upgradeable, non-custodial smart contracts that act as
  a central repository for yield and a router for users. It is modular, permissionless to list vaults,
  and enables intent-based transactions across chains.
