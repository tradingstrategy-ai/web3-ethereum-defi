  Protocol for real-world asset tokenisation and financing.
long_description: |
  Centrifuge is a protocol for real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation and financing.
  It enables borrowers to finance assets like invoices, real estate, and other
  tokenised assets without the need for banks or other intermediaries.

  Each pool can have multiple tranches, and each tranche is a separate deployment
  of an ERC-7540 Vault and a Tranche Token. Additionally, each tranche of a
  Centrifuge pool can have multiple Liquidity Pools (vaults) - one for each
  supported investment currency.

  The protocol implements ERC-7540 (asynchronous deposits/redemptions) on top of
  ERC-4626, enabling integration with Centrifuge's epoch-based investment system.

  One of the most popular Centrifuge users is Anemoy, which offers tokenised US assets
  like S&P 500 index, Janus Henderson AAA collateralised loan obligation ETF and US treasuries.
