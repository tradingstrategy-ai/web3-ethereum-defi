  Decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol built on MakerDAO/Sky infrastructure.
long_description: |
  Spark is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol built on top of the MakerDAO/Sky
  infrastructure. It allows users to participate as suppliers or borrowers, and provides
  yield-generating stablecoin products through the Sky Savings Rate (SSR).

  The sUSDC vault is an ERC-4626 compliant tokenised vault that allows users to deposit USDC
  and earn the Sky Savings Rate. The vault handles USDC deposits by converting USDC to USDS
  using the dss-lite-psm (Peg Stability Module) and then depositing into sUSDS to earn yield.

  Key features:

  - No deposit/withdrawal fees at the smart contract level
  - Yield accrues through the Sky Savings Rate (SSR)
  - Instant deposits and withdrawals (subject to PSM liquidity)
  - Fully backed by sUSDS (savings USDS)
