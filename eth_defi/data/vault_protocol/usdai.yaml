long_description: |
  USD.AI is a synthetic dollar protocol that bridges DeFi and artificial intelligence infrastructure.
  The protocol issues USDai, an overcollateralised stablecoin pegged to $1 and redeemable for stablecoins
  like USDC, with reserves deployed in income-generating AI/DePIN loans backed by NVIDIA GPUs.

  The dual-token system includes:

  - **USDai**: Non-yield-bearing synthetic dollar, highly liquid and composable
  - **sUSDai**: Yield-bearing ERC-4626 vault shares received when staking USDai

  Key features:

  - Synthetic dollar backed by tokenised U.S. Treasuries through the M0 platform
  - Yield generation from loans collateralised by GPU hardware in insured data centres
  - Each GPU is documented under U.S. commercial law and tokenised as an NFT
  - Chainlink Price Feeds integration for accurate on-chain rates
