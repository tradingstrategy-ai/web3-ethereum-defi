  Modular lending platform for lending and borrowing ERC-20 crypto assets.
long_description: |
  Euler is a modular lending platform that allows users to lend and borrow ERC-20 crypto assets
  in a decentralised, non-custodial manner. The platform is built on Ethereum and enables any
  asset to become collateral for a lending market.

  Euler v2 has two main components:

  - **Euler Vault Kit (EVK)**: A modular framework for building credit vaults - permissionless,
    composable ERC-4626 lending pools with added borrowing functionality
  - **Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC)**: An interoperability layer that connects vaults and allows
    their use as collateral for other vaults

  Key features:

  - Permissionless vault deployment with customisable risk parameters
  - Multicall batching and flash liquidity via EVC
  - Market-leading risk-adjusted rates for lenders and borrowers
  - Institutional-grade security with multiple audits
