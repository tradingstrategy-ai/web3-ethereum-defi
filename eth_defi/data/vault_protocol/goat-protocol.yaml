long_description: |
  Goat delivers market-leading yields - combining secure, liquidity-optimised vaults with rigorous
  risk management to maximise returns without compromising safety.

  Goat Protocol simplifies access to top-performing DeFi projects by offering multi-strategy yield
  vaults that act like robo-advisors. These vaults automatically allocate assets to the highest-performing
  yield strategies in DeFi. The vaults accept any asset which will be automatically converted into the
  base asset.

  By continuously analysing market trends and adjusting investment strategies accordingly, Goat Protocol
  ensures that users' assets are always allocated to the most lucrative yield-bearing positions. The
  protocol is maintained by independent developers and is governed by GOA holders.
