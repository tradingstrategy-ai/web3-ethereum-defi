class GMXClient:
    """
    Main client for interacting with the GMX protocol.

    This class serves as the primary entry point for all GMX protocol interactions,
    providing a unified interface that coordinates trading, market data access,
    liquidity management, and order handling. It follows a composition pattern
    where specialized managers handle different aspects of GMX functionality.

    The client automatically initializes all sub-modules and provides convenient
    access to configuration and wallet information. It's designed to be the single
    object developers need to interact with GMX across all supported networks.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Initialize GMX client for Arbitrum with read-only access
        config = GMXConfig(
            chain="arbitrum",
            rpc_url="https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc",
        )

        # Check configuration
        print(f"Connected to {gmx.get_chain()}")
        print(f"Write capability: {gmx.has_write_capability()}")

        # Access market data
        positions = gmx.market_data.get_positions()

        # Place trades (requires wallet configuration)
