"""
GMX Configuration Module.

This module provides the production-ready configuration management system for
GMX protocol integration, implementing automatic network detection, secure
wallet abstraction, and comprehensive authentication strategy support. It
represents the mature, stable implementation used in production trading
systems and financial applications.

Production Configuration Architecture
------------------------------------

This implementation focuses on reliability, security, and operational simplicity
for production environments. Automatic network detection eliminates configuration
errors, while sophisticated wallet abstraction provides universal compatibility
without compromising security or performance characteristics of individual
wallet implementations.

Key Production Features
-----------------------

- **Automatic Chain Detection**: Eliminates network configuration errors
- **Universal Wallet Support**: Compatible with all BaseWallet implementations
- **Security Isolation**: Strict separation between read and write operations
- **Production Stability**: Thoroughly tested patterns for reliable operation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserves legacy interfaces for existing systems

Security-First Design
---------------------

The production configuration implements defense-in-depth security patterns
where sensitive operations are isolated into separate configuration contexts.
Read-only configurations provide safe data access, while write configurations
implement comprehensive validation and secure credential delegation.

Operational Reliability
-----------------------

Production systems require configuration management that never fails unexpectedly.
This implementation includes comprehensive error handling, automatic validation,
and clear diagnostic information to prevent and resolve operational issues quickly.

Multi-Environment Support
-------------------------

The configuration system automatically adapts to different blockchain networks
while maintaining consistent interfaces and operational patterns. This enables
the same application code to work seamlessly across Arbitrum, Avalanche, and
other supported networks.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Basic configuration
    from web3 import Web3
    from eth_defi.gmx.config import GMXConfig

    # Configuration with automatic network detection
    web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc"))

    # Read-only configuration
    config = GMXConfig(web3)
    assert config.get_chain() == "arbitrum"

    # Configuration with wallet address for transaction building
    config_with_address = GMXConfig(web3, user_wallet_address="0x...")
    assert config_with_address.has_write_capability()

    # Get configuration manager for GMX protocol classes
    gmx_config_manager = config.get_config()
    print(f"Connected to {gmx_config_manager.chain} (ID: {gmx_config_manager.chain_id})")

Design Philosophy
-----------------

The production configuration embodies the principle of "secure by default"
where the safest operational mode is also the most convenient. Automatic
detection reduces human error, while security isolation prevents accidental
exposure of sensitive operations.

.. note::
    This is the recommended configuration implementation for production
    deployments where reliability and security are paramount considerations.

.. warning::
    Production configurations with write capabilities enable real financial
    transactions. Ensure proper security procedures and testing before
    deployment in environments with significant financial exposure.

class GMXConfig:
    """Production-grade configuration management system for secure GMX protocol integration.

    This class provides the stable, production-ready implementation of configuration
    management that powers real trading systems and financial applications. It
    implements automatic network detection, universal wallet compatibility, and
    comprehensive security controls while maintaining the simplicity and reliability
    required for production deployment.

    Production Architecture Principles
    ----------------------------------

    The production implementation prioritizes operational reliability, security
    isolation, and automatic error prevention. Network parameters are detected
    automatically to eliminate configuration errors, wallet integration uses
    secure adapter patterns to preserve individual security models, and comprehensive
    validation prevents common operational pitfalls.

    Security Architecture
    ---------------------

    The configuration system implements strict security boundaries between read
    and write operations. Read configurations provide safe data access without
    any exposure to sensitive credentials, while write configurations implement
    secure credential delegation through validated adapter interfaces.

    Operational Reliability
    -----------------------

    Production systems require configuration management that operates predictably
    under all conditions. This implementation includes comprehensive error handling,
    automatic parameter validation, and clear diagnostic information to enable
    rapid troubleshooting and reliable operation.

    Universal Wallet Compatibility
    ------------------------------

    Modern financial applications must support diverse wallet implementations
    to accommodate different security requirements and operational preferences.
    The configuration system provides seamless integration with any BaseWallet-
    compatible implementation while preserving the unique capabilities of each
    wallet type.
