GMX Trading Module

This module provides the fundamental trading execution capabilities for the GMX
protocol, implementing sophisticated position opening, closing, and token swapping
functionality through a unified, professional-grade interface. It serves as the
primary execution engine for all trading operations, translating high-level
trading intentions into precise protocol interactions.

**Trading System Architecture:**

Professional trading systems recognize that execution is where theoretical strategies
meet practical reality. The GMX Trading module implements this philosophy by
providing clean abstractions over complex protocol mechanics while maintaining
the precision and control needed for sophisticated trading strategies.

**Core Trading Operations:**

The module supports the three fundamental operations that form the foundation
of any comprehensive trading system:

- **Position Opening**: Creating new leveraged positions with precise size, collateral, and risk controls
- **Position Closing**: Exiting existing positions with strategic timing and asset selection
- **Token Swapping**: Converting between assets for portfolio rebalancing and strategy execution

**Leveraged Trading Mechanics:**

GMX operates as a sophisticated leveraged trading platform where traders can
open positions larger than their collateral through borrowed capital from
liquidity providers. This creates opportunities for amplified returns while
requiring careful risk management to prevent liquidation during adverse
market movements.

**Risk Management Integration:**

Every trading operation includes comprehensive risk controls including slippage
protection, leverage limits, collateral adequacy validation, and execution
parameter verification. The system prevents common trading errors while
maintaining the flexibility needed for advanced strategies.

**Strategic Trading Patterns:**

The module supports multiple trading patterns including:

- **Directional Trading**: Taking leveraged positions based on market analysis
- **Arbitrage Strategies**: Exploiting price discrepancies across markets or time
- **Delta Neutral Strategies**: Managing exposure through offsetting positions
- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Adjusting asset allocations based on changing market conditions

**Advanced Execution Features:**

- **Debug Mode Testing**: Validate all strategies without financial commitment
- **Flexible Parameter Control**: Precise control over execution timing and costs
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Trade across all GMX-supported markets and tokens
- **Slippage Management**: Dynamic slippage adjustment based on market conditions

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Professional trading workflow with comprehensive risk management
    web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc"))
    config = GMXConfig.from_private_key(web3, "0x...", chain="arbitrum")
    trader = GMXTrading(config)

    # Strategic position opening with precise risk parameters
    long_eth_order = trader.open_position(
        market_symbol="ETH",
        collateral_symbol="USDC",  # Use stable collateral
        start_token_symbol="USDC",  # Start with stable asset
        is_long=True,  # Bullish position

        debug_mode=True,  # Test execution first
        auto_cancel=True,  # Cancel if execution fails
    )

    # Execute if debug validation passes
    if not debug_mode:
        tx_receipt = long_eth_order.submit()
        print(f"Position opened: {tx_receipt.transactionHash.hex()}")

    # Strategic token swap for portfolio rebalancing
    swap_order = trader.swap_tokens(
        in_token_symbol="ETH",
        out_token_symbol="USDC",
        amount=1.5,  # Swap 1.5 ETH
        slippage_percent=0.01,  # 1% slippage for volatile swap
        execution_buffer=3.0,  # Higher execution buffer
        debug_mode=False,  # Execute real swap
    )

    # Risk management: Close position with strategic asset selection
    close_order = trader.close_position(
        market_symbol="ETH",
        collateral_symbol="USDC",
        start_token_symbol="USDC",
        is_long=True,
        size_delta_usd=2500,  # Close half the position
        initial_collateral_delta=800,  # Remove $800 collateral
        slippage_percent=0.003,  # Tight slippage for profit taking
        debug_mode=False,
    )

**Integration with Trading Strategies:**

The module is designed to integrate seamlessly with automated trading strategies,
risk management systems, and portfolio optimization algorithms. Its clean
interface and comprehensive parameter control make it suitable for both manual
trading and systematic strategy implementation.

Note:
    All trading operations require wallet configuration with transaction signing
    capabilities and sufficient collateral for the intended operations.

TODO:
    Add option to return tx_hash from all of the on-chain operations

Warning:
    Leveraged trading involves substantial risk of loss. Positions can be
    liquidated if market movements exceed collateral capacity. Never trade
    with more capital than you can afford to lose completely.

    **Trading System Philosophy:**

    The design follows professional trading system principles where execution
    quality is paramount. Every method provides comprehensive parameter control,
    extensive validation, and safety features including debug mode testing.
    The architecture supports both manual trading workflows and algorithmic

    **Leveraged Trading Architecture:**

    GMX's leveraged trading system allows traders to open positions larger than
    their collateral by borrowing capital from liquidity providers. This creates
    sophisticated risk/reward dynamics where successful trades can generate
    amplified returns, but unsuccessful trades can result in rapid capital loss
    through liquidation.

    **Risk Control Philosophy:**

    Every trading operation includes multiple layers of risk control including
    slippage protection, collateral adequacy validation, leverage limits, and
    execution parameter verification. The system prevents common trading errors

        Execute sophisticated position opening with comprehensive risk and execution control.

        This method creates leveraged trading positions on GMX with precise control
        over size, leverage, collateral composition, and execution parameters. It
        implements professional-grade position opening logic including collateral
        optimization, slippage protection, and execution cost management.

        **Leveraged Position Mechanics:**

        When you open a leveraged position, you're essentially borrowing capital
        from GMX liquidity providers to control a position larger than your
        collateral. The leverage multiplier determines how much capital you
        control relative to your collateral. Higher leverage amplifies both
        potential gains and losses, requiring careful risk management.

        **Collateral Strategy:**

        The choice of collateral asset affects both your risk profile and
        trading costs. Using stable collateral (like USDC) provides predictable
        liquidation thresholds but may incur swap costs. Using the same asset
        as collateral and position (like ETH) minimizes swap costs but creates
        concentrated risk exposure.

        **Position Sizing and Risk Management:**

        Professional traders use position sizing as their primary risk management
        tool. The size_delta_usd parameter should be calculated based on your
        total portfolio size, risk tolerance, and the specific characteristics
        of the market you're trading. Never risk more than you can afford to
        lose on any single position.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

        Execute strategic position closure with precise size and collateral control.

        This method provides sophisticated position closure capabilities with
        independent control over position size reduction and collateral withdrawal.
        It supports both full position closure and partial closure strategies
        that are essential for advanced risk management and profit optimization.

        **Position Closure Strategy:**

        Professional traders rarely close entire positions at once. Instead,
        they use partial closures to lock in profits while maintaining market
        exposure, reduce risk during uncertain periods, or free up collateral
        for new opportunities. This method provides the precision needed for
        these sophisticated strategies.

        **Collateral Management:**

        The independent control over collateral withdrawal allows for advanced
        capital management strategies. You might close 50% of a position size
        while withdrawing 75% of collateral to maximize capital efficiency, or
        close 100% of position size while leaving collateral for rapid re-entry.

        **Timing and Market Conditions:**

        Position closure timing can significantly impact profitability. The
        method provides slippage controls that allow traders to balance execution
        speed against price protection based on current market volatility and
        urgency of the closure requirement.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Profit-taking strategy: Partial closure with stable output
            profit_taking = trader.close_position(

        preparing assets for new position openings, and implementing arbitrage
        strategies across different markets or protocols.

        **Slippage and Execution Management:**

        Swap execution quality depends heavily on market conditions and swap
        size relative to available liquidity. The method provides dynamic
        slippage controls and execution buffers that can be adjusted based on
        market volatility, urgency, and the specific assets being swapped.

        **Integration with Trading Strategies:**

        Swaps often form part of larger trading strategies rather than standalone
        operations. The method supports integration with position management
        workflows, enabling complex strategies that combine position adjustments
        with asset rebalancing in coordinated sequences.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Portfolio rebalancing: Convert profits to stable assets
            profit_conversion = trader.swap_tokens(
                in_token_symbol="ETH",
                out_token_symbol="USDC",
                amount=2.5,  # Swap 2.5 ETH
                slippage_percent=0.01,  # 1% slippage tolerance
                execution_buffer=2.0,  # Standard execution buffer
                debug_mode=True,  # Test execution
                auto_cancel=True,
            )

            # Strategy preparation: Convert stable assets for position opening
            position_prep = trader.swap_tokens(
                in_token_symbol="USDC",
                out_token_symbol="BTC",
                amount=5000,  # Swap $5000 USDC
                slippage_percent=0.015,  # 1.5% slippage for large swap
                execution_buffer=3.0,  # Higher buffer for complex swap
                debug_mode=False,  # Execute real swap
                max_fee_per_gas=50000000000,  # Custom gas price
            )

        :param in_token_symbol:
            Symbol of the token to swap from (e.g., "ETH", "USDC").
            Must be an asset you currently hold in sufficient quantity
            for the intended swap amount
        :type in_token_symbol: str
        :param out_token_symbol:
            Symbol of the token to receive from the swap (e.g., "USDC", "BTC").
            Determines your final asset exposure and liquidity characteristics
            after the swap completion
        :type out_token_symbol: str
        :param amount:
            Quantity of the input token to swap. Must not exceed your current
            balance of the input token and should consider any held collateral
            requirements
        :type amount: float
        :param position_usd:
            Optional USD value for position-based swaps that integrate with
            broader trading strategies. Set to 0 for simple asset conversion
        :type position_usd: Optional[float]
        :param slippage_percent:
            Maximum acceptable slippage as decimal (0.02 = 2%). Higher values
            enable execution in volatile conditions but may result in worse
            prices than expected
        :type slippage_percent: Optional[float]
        :param execution_buffer:
            Multiplier for execution fee estimation to ensure successful
            transaction processing. Higher values reduce execution failure
            risk but increase transaction costs
        :type execution_buffer: float
        :param debug_mode:
            Whether to execute in debug mode for testing and validation.
            Debug mode simulates complete swap execution without spending
            gas or converting actual assets
        :type debug_mode: Optional[bool]
        :param kwargs:
            Additional advanced parameters for swap control including
            auto_cancel, max_fee_per_gas, and other swap-specific settings
        :type kwargs: Any
        :return:
            Configured swap order object ready for execution with all
            specified parameters and slippage controls applied
