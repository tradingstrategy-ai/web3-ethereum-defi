GMX Order Management Module

This module provides sophisticated order management and position control functionality
for the GMX protocol, implementing professional-grade trading system capabilities
through a unified, high-level interface. It serves as the command center for all
position lifecycle management, from opening to closing, with comprehensive risk
controls and flexible execution strategies.

**Position Management Philosophy:**

Professional trading systems recognize that opening a position is often the easy
part - the real skill lies in managing that position over time and closing it
optimally. The GMX Order Manager implements this philosophy by providing multiple
pathways for position closure, each designed for different strategic scenarios
and risk management requirements.

**Key Trading System Concepts:**

- **Position Lifecycle Management**: Complete control over position opening, monitoring, and closing
- **Risk Parameter Control**: Precise slippage, size, and collateral management
- **Multi-Strategy Support**: Different closing methods for different trading strategies
- **Debug-First Development**: Safe testing environment for strategy development
- **Flexible Asset Handling**: Choose exactly which assets to receive upon position closure

**Order Execution Strategies:**

The module supports multiple order execution patterns to accommodate different
trading styles and market conditions:

- **Parameter-Driven Orders**: Direct control over all order parameters for algorithmic strategies
- **Key-Based Position Management**: Simplified position closure using position identifiers
- **Partial Position Management**: Precise control over position sizing and collateral removal
- **Multi-Address Support**: Manage positions across different wallet addresses

**Risk Management Integration:**

Every order execution method includes comprehensive risk controls including slippage
protection, position size validation, and collateral management. The system prevents
common trading errors through parameter validation while maintaining the flexibility
needed for sophisticated trading strategies.

**Real-World Trading Scenarios:**

- **Profit Taking**: Close profitable positions while preserving capital for new opportunities
- **Loss Cutting**: Quickly exit losing positions to prevent further capital erosion
- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Adjust position sizes to maintain desired risk exposures
- **Liquidity Management**: Convert positions to desired assets based on market conditions
- **Emergency Risk Management**: Rapidly close positions during adverse market conditions

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Professional position management workflow
    web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc"))
    config = GMXConfig.from_private_key(web3, "0x...", chain="arbitrum")
    order_manager = GMXOrderManager(config)

    # Step 1: Assess current position portfolio
    positions = order_manager.get_open_positions()
    print(f"Currently managing {len(positions)} positions")

    # Step 2: Strategic position closure using key-based method
    if "ETH_long" in positions:
        # Take 50% profits while keeping position open
        close_order = order_manager.close_position_by_key(
            position_key="ETH_long",
            out_token_symbol="USDC",  # Convert to stable value
            amount_of_position_to_close=0.5,  # Close half the position
            amount_of_collateral_to_remove=0.3,  # Remove some collateral
            slippage_percent=0.005,  # 0.5% slippage tolerance
            debug_mode=True,  # Test execution first
        )

    # Step 3: Algorithmic position management with precise parameters
    risk_parameters = {
        "chain": "arbitrum",
        "index_token_symbol": "SOL",
        "collateral_token_symbol": "SOL",
        "start_token_symbol": "SOL",
        "is_long": True,
        "size_delta_usd": 1000,  # Close $1000 of position
        "initial_collateral_delta": 50,  # Remove 50 tokens collateral
        "slippage_percent": 0.01,  # 1% slippage for volatile market
    }

    algorithmic_order = order_manager.close_position(
        parameters=risk_parameters,
        debug_mode=False,  # Execute real order
    )

    # Step 4: Monitor and execute orders
    if not debug_mode:
        tx_receipt = algorithmic_order.submit()
        print(f"Position closed: {tx_receipt.transactionHash.hex()}")

**Integration with Trading Strategies:**

The order manager is designed to integrate seamlessly with automated trading
strategies, risk management systems, and portfolio optimization algorithms.
Its flexible parameter structure and comprehensive validation make it suitable
for both manual trading and systematic strategy implementation.

Note:
    All order operations require wallet configuration with transaction signing
    capabilities. Use debug mode extensively during strategy development to
    avoid costly execution errors in live markets.

Warning:
    Position management involves significant financial risk. Improper order
    execution can result in substantial losses. Always validate parameters
    and test strategies thoroughly before live execution.

        every aspect of the order execution. It's designed for algorithmic trading
        strategies and sophisticated manual trading where precise control over
        execution parameters is essential.

        **Parameter-Driven Trading:**

        This approach is particularly valuable for systematic trading strategies
        where order parameters are calculated algorithmically based on market
        conditions, risk metrics, or portfolio optimization algorithms. The
        comprehensive parameter structure ensures that strategies can implement
        sophisticated risk management and execution logic.

        **Advanced Risk Management:**

        The parameter structure supports advanced risk management techniques
        including dynamic slippage adjustment, partial position closure, selective
        collateral removal, and complex asset swap strategies. This enables
        implementation of professional-grade risk management systems.

        Execute strategic position closure using simplified position identification.

        This method provides an intuitive, high-level interface for position
        management by using human-readable position keys instead of complex
        parameter dictionaries. It's designed for manual trading workflows and
        simplified algorithmic strategies where ease of use is prioritized over
        granular parameter control.

        **Strategic Position Management:**

        The key-based approach excels in scenarios where traders think in terms
        of "close my ETH long position" rather than specific parameter combinations.
        It automatically handles the complex parameter translation while providing
        strategic controls over closure amount, collateral management, and output
        asset selection.

        **Partial Position Strategies:**

        The ability to close partial positions and remove partial collateral
        enables sophisticated position management strategies including profit
        taking, risk reduction, and portfolio rebalancing. These capabilities
        are essential for maintaining optimal risk exposure as market conditions
        evolve.

        **Asset Selection Strategy:**

        The choice of output token affects both immediate liquidity and ongoing
        risk exposure. Selecting stable tokens (USDC) locks in current values,
        while selecting volatile tokens (ETH) maintains price exposure. This
        strategic flexibility supports diverse trading and investment approaches.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Strategic profit-taking on successful position
            profit_taking_order = order_manager.close_position_by_key(
