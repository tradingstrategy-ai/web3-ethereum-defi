GMX Constants Module

This module serves as the central registry for all GMX protocol infrastructure
constants, including contract addresses, API endpoints, ABIs, and event signatures.
It provides a single source of truth for network-specific configuration data
that enables the GMX library to operate across multiple blockchain networks.

The constants are organized into several categories:

**API Endpoints**: Primary and backup URLs for GMX's REST API services, which
provide market data, price feeds, and other off-chain information.

**Contract Addresses**: On-chain smart contract addresses for core GMX protocol
components, organized by blockchain network (Arbitrum and Avalanche).

**ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces)**: Contract interface definitions that
enable Python code to interact with deployed smart contracts.

**Event Signatures**: Cryptographic signatures for important contract events
that allow efficient filtering and monitoring of on-chain activity.

This architectural approach allows the same codebase to work across multiple
networks by simply selecting the appropriate constants for the target blockchain.
The constants are loaded at module import time to ensure consistent configuration
throughout the application lifecycle.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access API endpoints for different networks
    arbitrum_api = GMX_API_URLS["arbitrum"]
    avalanche_api = GMX_API_URLS["avalanche"]

    # Get contract addresses for specific operations
    reader_address = GMX_READER_ADDRESS["arbitrum"]
    exchange_router = GMX_EXCHANGE_ROUTER_ADDRESS["avalanche"]

    # Use event signatures for blockchain monitoring
    position_event = EVENT_SIGNATURES["IncreasePosition"]

    # Load ABI for contract interaction
    event_emitter_abi = GMX_EVENT_EMITTER_ABI

    GMX maintains the API endpoints and official documentation can be found at:

    The Reader contract provides optimized read-only access to protocol data,

    from multiple protocol contracts, providing convenient interfaces for
    common data access patterns.
    
    Reader contracts are particularly important for user interfaces and
    analytics systems that need to efficiently query large amounts of protocol
    data. They implement gas-optimized functions that can return complex data
    structures in single calls, reducing the number of RPC requests needed
    for comprehensive protocol state queries.

Application Binary Interface (ABI) for the GMX Event Emitter contract.

The ABI defines the contract's interface, including function signatures, event

The Event Emitter ABI includes definitions for all events that the contract
can emit, such as position updates, liquidations, and funding rate changes.
