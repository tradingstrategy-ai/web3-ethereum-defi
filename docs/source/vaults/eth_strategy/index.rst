ETH Strategy API
----------------

`ETH Strategy <https://www.ethstrat.xyz/>`__ integration.

ETH Strategy is a DeFi treasury protocol that offers leveraged ETH exposure without risk of
liquidation or volatility decay. It operates as Ethereum's first autonomous treasury protocol,
designed to reimagine MicroStrategy's approach in a DeFi-native context.

The ESPN (ETH Strategy Perpetual Note) vault is an ERC-4626 compliant vault that allows users
to deposit USDS stablecoins. The protocol takes no fees on deposits or redemptions and is
DAO-governed with rage quit functionality.
