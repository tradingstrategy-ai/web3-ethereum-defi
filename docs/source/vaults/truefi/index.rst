TrueFi API
-------------------

`TrueFi <https://truefi.io/>`__ vault integration.

TrueFi is DeFi's first and largest credit protocol, connecting lenders, borrowers, and portfolio
managers via smart contracts governed by the TRU token. Lenders enjoy predictable, transparent
yields on real-world and crypto-native lending. Borrowers and portfolio managers get access to
competitively priced capital with no collateral lockup.

Since its launch in November 2020, TrueFi has originated more than $1.7bn in loans to over 30
borrowers and paid more than $40mm in interest to protocol participants. Borrowers include both
leading crypto-focused institutions and real-world firms, such as fintech companies, trading
firms, and credit funds.
