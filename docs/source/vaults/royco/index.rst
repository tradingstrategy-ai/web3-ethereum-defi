Royco API
---------

`Royco Protocol <https://royco.org/>`__ integration.

Royco is an Incentivised Action Market (IAM) Protocol that enables protocols to create
incentivised ERC-4626 vault wrappers with integrated rewards systems. The WrappedVault
contract wraps underlying vaults and adds flexible reward distribution functionality,
supporting up to 20 simultaneous reward programmes.

Royco allows protocols to deploy incentive campaigns for their vaults, enabling users
to earn rewards in the form of ERC-20 tokens or points programmes alongside the underlying
vault yield.
