aarnâ API
---------

`aarnâ protocol <https://www.aarna.ai/>`__ integration.

aarnâ develops an Agentic Onchain Treasury (AOT), a fully autonomous onchain treasury
that allocates, rotates, and secures assets through programmable, transparent agent governance.
The system uses AI agents (âTARS) to manage decentralised finance complexity without requiring
users to navigate DeFi themselves. Users maintain non-custodial control, with assets remaining
in their own wallets while they access services across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Sonic networks.

The platform offers tokenised vault products (âtv series) that provide structured exposure to
various asset classes. These vaults operate through autonomous agents that analyse market conditions
and execute allocation strategies. Vaults are compliant with ERC-4626 standards for seamless composability.
