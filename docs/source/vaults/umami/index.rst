Umami API
----------

`Umami DAO <https://umami.finance/>`__ vault protocol integration.

Built on the upgraded GMX v2 platform, GM Vaults enable users to deposit single tokens like BTC, ETH, USDC and ARB, while eliminating impermanent loss through automated hedging that we call internal netting. These vaults utilize the GM Index (GMI) to manage deposits and generate yield from four distinct synthetic pools on GMX V2, ensuring a stable and lucrative environment for depositors.
