Superform API
-------------

`Superform <https://www.superform.xyz/>`__ vault integration.

Superform is a permissionless cross-chain yield marketplace designed for DeFi protocols, allowing
them to list their vaults or asset pools. SuperVaults offer a simple way to get the best yields
onchain without needing to check rates or rebalance your portfolio.

Interest is primarily generated through fixed-rate and variable-rate onchain lending products.
The Superform Protocol is a suite of non-upgradeable, non-custodial smart contracts that act as
a central repository for yield and a router for users. It is modular, permissionless to list vaults,
and enables intent-based transactions across chains.
