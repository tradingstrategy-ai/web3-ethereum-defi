`Curvance protocol <https://www.curvance.com/>`__ integration.

Curvance is a next-generation DeFi lending protocol designed for capital-efficient money markets
with advanced risk management across multiple blockchains. The protocol enables users to deposit
collateral, borrow assets, and participate in yield optimisation strategies through a non-custodial
architecture.

Key features include risk-isolated lending markets, auto-compounding vaults, one-click looping
for maximised capital efficiency, and dual oracle protection for accurate pricing. Curvance is
deployed on Monad, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and other chains.
