Goat protocol API
-----------------

`Goat Protocol <https://goat.fi/>`__ integration.

Goat delivers market-leading yields — combining secure, liquidity-optimised vaults with rigorous
risk management to maximise returns without compromising safety.

Goat Protocol simplifies access to top-performing DeFi projects by offering multi-strategy yield
vaults that act like robo-advisors. These vaults automatically allocate assets to the highest-performing
yield strategies in DeFi. The vaults accept any asset which will be automatically converted into the
base asset.

By continuously analysing market trends and adjusting investment strategies accordingly, Goat Protocol
ensures that users' assets are always allocated to the most lucrative yield-bearing positions. The
protocol is maintained by independent developers and is governed by GOA holders.
