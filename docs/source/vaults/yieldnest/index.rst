`YieldNest protocol <https://www.yieldnest.finance>`__ integration.

YieldNest is a decentralised finance platform designed to simplify complex DeFi strategies. The protocol offers simple, high-yielding, risk-adjusted restaking and DeFi strategies, consolidating multiple protocol exposures into unified assets with Layer 1 settlement guarantees. This approach removes friction for both retail and institutional participants seeking yield optimisation.

The platform's core mission centres on democratising DeFi access through secure, innovative products. By merging disparate DeFi opportunities into single, manageable assets, YieldNest enables users to gain diversified exposure across multiple protocols and chains simultaneously. The team emphasises non-custodial solutions with robust security measures, positioning the protocol as a bridge between traditional finance users and decentralised systems.

YieldNest maintains an active community presence and development roadmap. The protocol offers various strategies including ynETH, ynBNB, and RWA-focused vaults, reflecting its expansion beyond pure crypto into real-world asset integration.
