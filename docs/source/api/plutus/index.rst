Plutus API
----------

`Plutus protocol <https://plutus.fi//>`__ integration.

PLUTUS is the cross-chain yield- and governance layer backing the Plutus protocol and ecosystem.

The yield-bearing and vote-enabling escrowed version xPLUTUS is made available on each chain PLUTUS, the LayerZero OFT, is deployed on.

Plutus buys back PLUTUS using revenue and productive treasury funds and distributes this PLUTUS -denominated real yield to xPLUTUS stakers. Thus funneling circulating supply to those most aligned with the protocol.
