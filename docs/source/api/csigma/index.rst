cSigma Finance API
------------------

`cSigma Finance <https://csigma.finance/>`__ integration.

cSigma Finance is a blockchain-based protocol that connects global borrowers and lenders
by standardising and streamlining the commercial lending process. The protocol offers
crypto-uncorrelated yield opportunities to stablecoin holders through tokenised real-world
assets (RWA) and risk-adjusted DeFi strategies.

csUSD allows users to deposit stablecoins and earn yield from two sources:
RWA credit markets and onchain DeFi yield strategies. The protocol dynamically
allocates between these sources based on market conditions to optimise yield performance.

As of Q1 2025, cSigma Finance has tokenised over $80 million in business loans from
mid-market companies across the United States, European Union, and Asia. The tokenised
loans are accessible on 11 major blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB.
