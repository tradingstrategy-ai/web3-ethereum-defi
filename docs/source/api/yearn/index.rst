Yearn vaults API
----------------

`Yearn <https://yearn.fi//>`__ vault integration.

Yearn Vaults (aka yVaults) are capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users do not need to have extensive knowledge of the underlying DeFi protocols and can use the vaults as passive-investing strategies.
Backed by Fasanara Capital, a leading institutional asset manager and fintech investing pioneer, we specialise in creating on-chain credit and delta-neutral yield strategies involving both RWAs and crypto natives.
