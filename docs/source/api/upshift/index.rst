Upshift protocol API
--------------------

Upshift democratises institutional-grade DeFi yield strategies through non-custodial vaults
built on August infrastructure. The platform handles three main product offerings:

**Upshift Lend**: An on-chain lending platform providing overcollateralised positions
with institutional borrowers, emphasising KYC/KYB verification and real yield opportunities.

**Upshift DeFi Yield**: Access to yield strategies curated and executed by some of the
best-performing DeFi funds, offering institutional-level risk management previously
unavailable to retail participants.

**Vault-as-a-Service (VaaS)**: A streamlined solution for ecosystems and protocols
looking to offer tailored vault opportunities, utilising the ERC-4626 standard alongside
August smart contracts.

The vaults operate as non-custodial structures, meaning users maintain control over their assets.
The implementation leverages the ERC-4626 Vault Standard, a widely-adopted Ethereum standard
for tokenised vaults.
