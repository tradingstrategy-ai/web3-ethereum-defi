ERC-4626: current APY of a vault
================================

Here is a Python example how to estimate the ERC-4626 `APY <https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/annual-percentage-yield-apy>`__.

- Reads the most recent APY of given ERC-4626 `vault <https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/vault>`__

- The APY is calculated using the price difference of the vault share token

- Only uses EVM JSON-RPC and archive node, no external services needed. Public RPC nodes won't work,
  because they are not archive nodes. Get your Base node JSON-RPC access from `dRPC <https://drpc.io/>`__ or `Ethereumnodes.com <https://ethereumnodes.com/>`__.

- Supported vaults include all ERC-4626, including but not limited to: Morpho, Euler, Lagoon Finance, Superform, IPOR, Yearn, Fluid

Then to run this script:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Get JSON-RPC archive node
    export JSON_RPC_BASE=...
    python scripts/erc-4626/read-live-apy.py

Output looks like:

.. code-block:: none
